# Port forwarding is not working, why?

If port forwarding is enabled while the VPN is connected, you will have to restart the VPN connection for the port to be accessible.

In addition, port forwarding is **disabled on all USA exit servers** to discourage file sharing on USA servers which results in our servers being disconnected by our upstream network providers.

We appreciate that there are legitimate reasons to forward ports, but at this time if you want to use the port forwarding service you must do so on a non-USA server.
