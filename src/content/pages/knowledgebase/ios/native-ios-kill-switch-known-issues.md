# Known issues with Native iOS Kill Switch

A list of known issues with the Kill Switch enabled for VPN tunnel in the iOS app:

* [OpenVPN] OpenVPN tunnel will take slightly longer to reconnect to a different gateway
* [OpenVPN] When switching networks, OpenVPN tunnel will reconnect instead of just routing traffic through a different network interface
* Approx. 1-3 seconds delay to engage the Kill Switch after VPN is connected, and the same delay to disengage it after VPN is disconnected
