# Mock Location Option

Most of the Android devices have the inbuilt feature of mock locations. Though the feature is reserved for developers, and you need to enable the Developer Options beforehand. If you don't do it yet, please read this [guide](/knowledgebase/android/developer-options-on-the-android-phone/).

Selecting IVPN as a mock location app allows fake information about your phone location by GPS and network operator. The fake location will match the gateway location you connected to.

### Enable Mock Location

To use this feature, go to **Settings > System > Advanced > Developer Options** and choose **Select mock location app** option in the **Debugging**.
