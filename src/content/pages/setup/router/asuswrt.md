2.  Launch the web browser and enter the IP address of your router, which is usually `192.168.1.1`.

4.  Look for the extracted earlier configuration files, select the one with the preferred server location and click on the `Upload` button.

5.  Enter your IVPN account ID that begins with letters 'ivpnXXXXXXXX' or 'i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX' and any password in the **Username** & **Password** fields accordingly.

    <div markdown="1" class="notice notice--info">
    Only your account ID is used for the authentication and is case-sensitive. The password field can be empty or set to anything, like <strong>"ivpn"</strong>, if your client requires a non-blank password.
    </div>

6.  Set the **Accept DNS Configuration** to **Strict**. In the **Custom Configuration** fill in the following:

    ```
    tls-client
    tls-cipher TLS-DHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-CBC-SHA
    key-direction 1
    resolv-retry infinite
    keepalive 10 60
    nobind
    persist-key
    persist-tun
    persist-remote-ip
    verb 3
    ```

7.  Click on `Apply` on the bottom of the page and your router should now be connected to IVPN. To confirm the latter, check the **Online status** tool on our website or visit the [dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com/).

### Configuring DNS

1. On your router, navigate to `WAN` - `Internet Connection`

2. Under **WAN DNS Setting** set **Connect to DNS Server automatically** to **No**

3. Specify one of the following DNS servers in the `DNS Server1` field:

    * *10.0.254.1* = redular DNS with no blocking
    * *10.0.254.2* = standard AntiTracker to block advertising and malware domains
    * *10.0.254.3* = AntiTracker Hardcore Mode to also block Google and Facebook

    ..and *198.245.51.147* in the `DNS Server2` field.

4. Hit `Apply` to save the changes.

### Configuring a Kill-Switch

1.  Navigate to `VPN` -> `OpenVPN Client`

2.  Under **Advanced Settings** select **Redirect Internet Traffic: Policy Rules**

3.  Have the **Block routed clients if tunnel goes down** option **Enabled**

4.  In the **Rules for routing client traffic through the tunnel** add your local network:  
    * **Description** - give it any name
    * **Source IP** - e.g. 192.168.1.0/24 (substitute with your real local network's IP address)
    * **Destination IP** - blank
    * **Iface** - VPN

### Final steps

1. Reboot your router and wait for a minute or two for everything to settle, then reboot your computer system.

2. Check the assigned public IP address on our website and run a leak test at [https://www.dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com) from one of the devices connected to your AsusWRT router.

**Please note:** If you plan to use a Multi-hop setup please see [this guide](/knowledgebase/general/how-can-i-connect-to-the-multihop-network/) and make the required changes in the .ovpn config file.
