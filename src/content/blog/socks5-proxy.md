Today we're launching our new SOCKS5 proxy service, available on all IVPN servers. This enables multiple new features but for me the most exciting is the ability to configure individual apps (or tabs!) that support SOCKS5 to route their traffic through a different VPN server than the one they are connected to. For example you could connect to the Paris VPN server using the IVPN app but configure your Firefox web browser to exit the Singapore VPN server. All the traffic generated by apps on your device will by default exit the Paris server except for traffic from the Firefox web browser which will exit the Singapore VPN server. 

This feature is supercharged by the Firefox Multi-account Containers addon which enables you to configure a different SOCKS5 proxy for each tab of the Firefox browser. In addition you can associate specific websites with a container and anytime you open the website it will open in the associated container and all traffic will be routed through the associated VPN gateway. So for example you can create a container to route traffic through the London, UK server and associate the BBC news website with that container. Anytime you visit this website Firefox will launch it in the associated container and the connection will be routed through the London, UK server without you having to do anything. See example below:

1. Force traffic to be unrouteable if the VPN connection is terminated (application killswitch). The IVPN app firewall already prevents any traffic leaking outside of the VPN connection whilst connected however you may want an additional killswitch if you need to disable the IVPN firewall to access local or remote resources. This works because our SOCKS5 proxies are only available when the VPN is connected, so if the VPN is disconnected, the proxy is not available and no traffic can leak from the application.


What is a socks5 proxy?

How is this implemented?
