IVPN Warrant Canary
===================

Once per month IVPN will publish a 'warrant canary' in the form of a cryptographically signed message containing the following:

- A declaration that, up to that point, no warrants have been served, nor have any searches or seizures taken place.
- Headlines from a major news source demonstrating that the update could not have been created prior to that date.

Special note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this page. However this scheme is not infallible.  Although signing the declaration makes it impossible for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force to coerce IVPN to produce false declarations.  

The current message is here:

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

As of 2022-04-03 no warrants have ever been served to IVPN or IVPN employees. No searches or seizures of any kind have ever been performed on IVPN assets. IVPN has no direct or indirect knowledge of any backdoors, or potential backdoors in our servers or network and IVPN has not received any requests to implement a backdoor. IVPN has never disclosed any user communications to any third party.
